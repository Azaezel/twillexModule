// Thanks to Lukas Joergensen for adding

//   * Torque3D support! (z values and a schedule-based loop)

//   * Global variables

//   * running eval() on the completion of a Tween



// DOWNLOAD AND DOCUMENTATION

// For the latest version and instructions/discussions/etc. go to http://sourceforge.net/p/twillex

// There you will also find a "Twillex Test Game" which is realy a scene that lets you manipulate

// Tween parameters and see what happens.

// A decent amount of instructions are below, though, to get started quickly.

// DEFINITION:

// Twillex provides animation, or "tweening", between the current state of an object and a given state.

// The "state" can be represented by *any* combination of fields, such as position, blendColor,

// size, rotation, text, or your own custom fields like myField.  There are short-cuts for fields

// of the common scene object.  specifically, x and y for position, sx and sy for size, and

// r, g, b, and a for color.

// There are many interpolation methods to provide "easing" to your Tweens.  Easing is the animation

// technique of speeding up at the beginning and/or slowing down at the end, called easing in and out,

// respectively.  Easing options include linear, quadratic, "bounce," "elastic,"

// and other common ones.



// USE:

// Setup a Twillex "engine" to run tweens.  See the section SETUP below.  In our examples, we'll assume

// it is named Tweener.

// Then create Tweens by calling your Twillex engine's to() function:

//    %t = Tweener.to(1000, %banner, "position:100 0, rotation:-45, r:0.2");
//    %t.play();

// Here we built a Tween (controlled by Tweener).  It will run for 1 second (1000 milliseconds),

// and it will affect the %banner object.  We see that it will vary the fields 'position' -- which

// is a two-element vector, by the way -- 'rotation', and the red component of the blendColor.

// The Tween sits dormant until you command it to play, which we did.  Suppose this is a button or

// HUD component and the time has come to show it again:

//    %t.rewind();

//    %t.play();

// Now send it back where it came from:

//    %t.reverse();

//    %t.play();

// Then when the Tween is no longer needed like at the end of the scene:

//    %t.delete();

// Here is an example of a one-off Tween:

//    %t = Tweener.toOnce(500, %banner, "x:100, y:0, myVar:0.01", "yoyo:true");

// Twillex cannot be sure what your fields will be called so it accepts them all, such as "position"

// or "text" or "myVar".  You may get an error at run-time if the field didn't exist or wasn't a

// short-cut field as was described earlier.  We also see a second string which holds control params that affect

// the way the Tween plays out.  Due to our "yoyo" param, this Tween plays through then plays

// backwards to the beginning and stops (all within 500 milliseconds).  Since we wanted a one-time

// Tween, we used toOnce().  This is a convenience function which calls play() for you and also

// add a parameter "delete:true" so that the Tween deletes itself on completion.  You could have used

// to() and added the parameter yourself and also called play().

// see $Twillex::paramValues for a complete list of parameters to affect the Tween



// SETUP/TEARDOWN/MAINTENANCE:

// To create a Twillex engine requires set up, tear down, and frame updates.

// Setup and tear-down work as usual in Torque.

// First, include the script

//    exec("<your_path>/Twillex.cs");

// Then, create a Twillex engine to run your tweens.

//   Twillex::create(Tweener);

// You could even make several Twillex engines if you wanted to keep categories of Tweens separate.
// In the end, delete your Twillex objects as usual:

//    Tweener.delete();

// It's not possible to get Torque to call an onUpdate() on Twillex objects each frame.

// The scene graph will have to be kind and call Twillex::onUpdate().

// For example:

// function mySceneGraph::onUpdateSceneTick(%this) {

//    // do all the other stuff also

//    Tweener.onUpdate();

// }

// Or if you prefer, instead of calling t2dSceneGraph::onUpdateSceneTick,

// call Twillex::startUpdates() once and it will continue to schedule Twillex::onUpdate().

// Note: Torque3D does not have a scene graph onUpdateSceneTick() and must use this function.


//   Tweener.startUpdates();

// Note that you don't have to call onUpdate on the individual Tweens, just the Twillex engines.
